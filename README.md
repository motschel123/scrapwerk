# scrapwerk

Scrapwerk scraps the [e-werk](https://www.e-werk.de/programm/alle-termine/) webpage, for all events happening in the next 7 days.

Furthermore, for each event it creates a calendar event into a personal [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com).
(Notice: in order to gain access to the googleapi, access to the "testers"-role of the corresponding googleapi-project has to be granted. Please reach out to me if you are interested in using this feature.)
